            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I've lived in Florida all my life, raised in the Tampa Bay area, and lived in the Pensacola area for the past fifteen years. I served in our military as a hospital corpsman for our United States Navy, passionately serving our aviation service men in women from 2009-2013. I have a passion for wrestling, my high school sport, which I have shared with my communities in Pace and Milton as a wrestling coach. I am a happy husband to my wife of seven years, Brandi, and father to my two children, Grayson (7) and Jonni (4). In all that I am, I strive to be a Christian first and reflect Christ in my actions and decisions. My goal is to serve my community honorably and help them protect their homes. When storms, insurance companies, and the everyday struggles of life present barriers to protecting your home, I hope to be your solution.</p>
